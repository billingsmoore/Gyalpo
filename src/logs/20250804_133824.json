Poverty and debt are seen as causes of suffering, immorality, and social unrest if they prevent one from having basic necessities and peace of mind. For laypeople, Buddhism promotes the middle way between a life of poverty and a materialistic or consumerist life in which one is always seeking to enrich oneself and to buy more things.[181] For Buddhist laypersons then, to be Buddhist does not mean to reject all material things, but, according to Sizemore and Swearer: \"it specifies an attitude to be cultivated and expressed in whatever material condition one finds oneself. To be non-attached is to possess and use material things but not to be possessed or used by them. Therefore, the idea of non-attachment applies all across Buddhist society, to laymen and monk alike.\"[182]\n\n^ Keown, Damien; Buddhist Ethics A Very Short Introduction, pg 5.\n\n^ Peter Harvey An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics Cambridge University Press 2000, page 19.\n\n^ Keown 2003, p.\u00a0268.\n\n^ a b Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., Buddhism.

  "response": "Buddhism strongly discourages stealing. While it doesn't necessarily forbid all material possessions, it views greed and craving for wealth as negative, emphasizing contentment as true wealth. Poverty and debt are seen as sources of suffering and potential causes of social unrest if they prevent basic needs and peace of mind. For laypeople, Buddhism advocates for a balanced approach, avoiding both extreme poverty and excessive materialism. The key is to cultivate non-attachment \u2013 to use material things without being controlled or defined by them. This principle of non-attachment applies to all Buddhists, both lay and monastic."
